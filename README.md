# latent-space-generative-vision-pipeline
An end-to-end machine learning pipeline for learning, analyzing, and generating images from a personal food photo archive. The project progresses from autoencoder-based latent representations to latent diffusion using a pretrained Stable Diffusion VAE, with extensive analysis of reconstruction quality, latent structure, and generative performance.
